# TaskManger

A simple Task Manager built with React to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks.  
This project was created as part of a React practice session (Week 6 Day 5). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

##  Features

- Add new tasks with title/description
- Mark tasks as completed / pending
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Filter or view tasks by status (if implemented in UI)
- Local state or Redux store for predictable state management (see `/redux` folder)

> Tip: If youâ€™ve added extra features (due dates, priority, persistence, drag-and-drop), list them here.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
React (Create React Appâ€“style scripts: start, build)

CSS/HTML/JS

Redux (based on /redux directory) or local state with hooks

If youâ€™re using additional libraries (React Router, Redux Toolkit, Axios, etc.), add them here.

 Available Scripts
npm start â€” Runs the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000/

npm run build â€” Builds the app for production into /build

 Configuration
No environment variables are required by default.
If you integrate APIs or persistence, document your .env keys here:

bash
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<your-api>
How It Works (high level)
State Management
Tasks are kept in component state or a Redux slice (see /redux). Actions handle add/edit/toggle/delete.

Components

TaskForm for creating/updating tasks

TaskList to render tasks

TaskItem for individual task controls

Pages / Routing
Page components under /pages compose the UI. If you add React Router, document routes here.

 Roadmap
 Persist tasks to localStorage or backend API

 Search & filter by priority / date

 Drag-and-drop reordering

 Unit tests for reducers and components

 Dark mode
